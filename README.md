# User documentation for Okeanos

[Okeanos](https://okeanos.dev/) is a fully-managed service based on Gardener
to deliver Kubernetes clusters at scale everywhere, currently in public beta.

[Login to the dashboard](https://dashboard.okeanos.dev) is possible with your
existing GitHub account. After the first login a new project will be
automatically created for you. Please reload the dashboard after a few seconds
to see this project. You can then add your credentials for the cloud to be used
and create Kubernetes clusters that will use virtual machines in that cloud
account, and we provide and manage the Kubernetes Control Plane on our own
infrastructure.

The clouds currently available are AWS, GCP, Azure, Hetzner Cloud, Fugacloud,
Betacloud and CityCloud. We are currently working on support for IONOS and OVH.
During the public beta, the only cost for using Okeanos is the cost on your
own cloud account, charged directly by the cloud provider.

We do not ask for payment information and will not charge you for the control
plane of the managed Kubernetes clusters. The service and support is offered
on a best effort basis for free accounts until further notice.

## Hetzner Cloud

The following describes how a [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/de/cloud)
project is integrated into Okeanos.

* Login to the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/projects), click the
  ``NEUES PROJEKT`` button and create a new project, e.g. with the name ``okeanos-rocks``.

* Now switch to the dashboard of the new project and select the
  ``API TOKENS`` tab in the ``Sicherheit`` panel.
